### Course Description
This class will explore various platforms for the design and creation of AR and VR applications. Emphasizing hands-on experimentation, this experiential studio is meant to be a collaboration between both programmers and designers to research and develop new paradigms for user experience and new pipelines for the creation of 3D content. Using real time game engines, and various hardware equipment and mobile devices, students will work individually and in teams to practically apply novel design principles to build new applications, culminating in a semester project demonstrating a critical approach to designing for these emerging forms of media.

### Class Format
Mixed Reality is a rapidly evolving field, both professionally and pedagogically. Encompassing VR, AR, and any number of trendy buzzwords such as "experiential" and immersive, it stretches across disciplines and can be informed by a variety of expertise. In Mixed Reality Studio, we created an environment where students can experiment with new techniques and practices, which are themselves in constant flux as the technology changes and finds its audience. The emphasis in the beginner class was to develop a functional familiarity with a wide breadth of topics.

Advanced Mixed Reality will build on that familiarity by narrowing its scope, focusing deeper on specific implementations of Mixed Reality and culminating in a fully developed AR project for general public use.

The class will be structured as a series of **Chapters**, each building on the last:

* **Chapter 0** - _Recap topics_ - Focused on making sure everyone is back up to speed and re-familiarized with Unity and C# development.
* **Chapter 1** - _Expanding on Fundamentals_ - A series of class discussions, lectures, and exercises. Allowing us to dive deep into specific concepts and explore techniques.
* **Chapter 2** - _Interactive AR_ - We will be developing a mobile AR application based on the Vuforia framework
* **Chapter 3** - _Shared AR Experience_ - We will build on the previous project to develop a multi-user AR project

As before, we will be on our feet. We will move fast and break things so that we learn how to fix them. We may venture outside and get our hands dirty. You will be asked to split into groups - others may be relying on you to complete a portion of a larger project and it will be your responsibility to deliver.

Also, as before, this course is new and in flux. The schedule below is tentative and will _very likely_ change. Please check this git repository each week to find the most up to date schedule and topics.

### Reading and Course Notes
This course will not have an assigned textbook. Rather, students are required to read or watch additional material as assigned each session. We will be leaning heavily on participation and discussion in this course, and these readings will help get a better intuition and deeper understanding into relevant topics.

All relevant materials, notes, and referenced texts will be made available via this git repository as soon as possible after each session.

### Outcomes
Participants will show proficiency in the following student learning outcomes.

1. Develop understanding of Mixed Reality design and development concept and practices
2. Develop familiarity with a cross-section of Mixed Reality hardware.
3. Develop proficiency designing for experience and space rather than pixels.
4. Complete hands-on exercises and projects to demonstrate familiarity with concepts of Mixed Reality.

### Content
The following course content will be covered.

1. Intermediate/Advanced concepts in the Unity game engine.
2. Intermediate Programming Concepts, implemented in C# and JavaScript
3. The Current State of Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality.
4. Designing for space instead of screens.
5. Thorough Hands-on work Apple iOS/ARKit, Android/ARCore, HTC Vive, and Microsoft Hololens
6. Basic User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design.
7. Introduction to shared project-management methods (git, trello, etc.)

### Assessment
Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria.

1. Active and verbal participation in in-class discussion to demonstrate completion and understanding of concepts and assigned reading.
2. Careful attention to execution, technique and completion of projects
3. Personal challenge and effort in project development
4. Deadline compliance
5. Performance in student learning outcomes

### Grading
Your final grade will be made up from:

* Participation, attendance, and projects/exercises as assigned: 50%
* Project 1 - Interactive AR: 20%
* Final Project - Shared AR Experience: 30%

### Guidelines and Policies
Please review the official department guidelines and policies on the [printed syllabus](https://github.com/ivaylopg/AdvancedMixedRealityStudio/blob/master/SyllabusTech3707.pdf).

## Coding Resources
* [Mixed Reality Studio]() - The course materials from the beginner version of this class, including notes, useful code snippets, and Unity packages
* [Hello Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bPQ9L0hvXM&list=PL64OnOdZ_3NGD4qvRucx7BpKUZ-IqGc0Q) is a great place to start that would specifically help you in _this_ class. He covers a good intro to Unity as well as coding in general.
* One of my favorite general learn-to-code resources is anything by [Daniel Shiffman](https://vimeo.com/shiffman/collections) at NYU. He has a series of videos called [Computer Programming for the Total Beginner](https://vimeo.com/channels/introcompmedia), but once you've got the very very basics down (what are variables? what are functions?) I would highly recommend his video series [The Nature of Code: Simulating Natural Systems with Processing](https://vimeo.com/channels/natureofcode).
* Harvard's intro to CS class is available via HarvardX and youtube: [Harvard CS50 2012](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T3827MXcOrlJChW2B-gIH81Lx) or [CS50 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4SGkB_8fFs&list=PLhQjrBD2T382VRUw5ZpSxQSFrxMOdFObl)
