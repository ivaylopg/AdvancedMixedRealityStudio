# Session 08 - Responding to image-recognition events

In addition to the notes, don't forget to take a look at:

- [MarkerDetected.cs](https://github.com/ivaylopg/AdvancedMixedRealityStudio/blob/master/CodeAndResources/VuforiaExamples/MarkerDetected.cs)
- The [Unity Singleton](https://github.com/ivaylopg/AdvancedMixedRealityStudio/blob/master/CodeAndResources/UnitySingletonExample.cs) example

Both of these can be found in the `CodeAndResources` folder of this repo
